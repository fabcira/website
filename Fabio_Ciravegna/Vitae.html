<h3>Summary</h3>
    Prof Dr. Fabio Ciravegna is Professor of Language and Knowledge Technologies and Head of OAK Group in the
    Department of Computer Science. His research focuses on knowledge and information management over large scale. The research covers 3 main areas:
    <ul>
        <li>How to capture information over large scale (the Web, the Social Web, distributed organisational archives, mobile devices, drones, sensors, etc.) </li>
        <li>How to use the captured information (e.g. for knowledge management, business intelligence, customer analysis, management of large scale events via social media, etc.)</li>
        <li>How to communicate the information (to final users, problem owners, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    He is currently Director of the <a href="http://setamobility.eu">EU Project Seta</a>
    (15 partners, €5.5M funds) on  ubiquitous data and services for efficient, effective, safe,
    resilient mobility in metropolitan areas.<br/>
    Fabio is also the designer and lead Android developer for <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/active10/home">Active 10</a>, a mobile tracker and a large server infrastructure
    tracking physical movements at sub-minute level. Active 10 is distributed by Public Health England and has over
    530,000 users.<br/>
    Fabio is PI in two projects funded by <a href="http://footballwhispers.com">Football Whispers</a> (on large scale analysis of social media messages)
    and the UK Government (on developing a mobile app tracking physical activities to support healthier living). He is also the University of Sheffield lead for the <a href="https://www.movemoresheffield.com/">MoveMore Sheffield</a> initiative
    for which he developed the physical activity tracking app.
<br/>
    In 2012-2016 he was the director of the <a href="http://wesenseit.eu">European Project WeSenseIt</a>  (14 partners, €5.5M) on creating citizen observatories of water.
    In 2006-2010 he was director of the EU Integrated Project IST X-Media (15 partners, €13.6m budget) and in
    2002-2005 he was director of the EU project Dot.Kom. <br/>
    From 2009 to 2012 he was Director of Research and Innovation in the Digital
    World for the University of Sheffield, coordinating activities over 5 faculties.
    <br/>He holds a PhD from the University of East Anglia and a Laurea Degree from the University of Torino, Italy.
