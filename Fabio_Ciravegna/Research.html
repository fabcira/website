                <p>I coordinate the OAK Group at the department of computer science. We focus on knowledge and
                    information
                    management over large scale. The research covers 3 main areas:<br/></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How to capture information over large scale (the Web, the Social Web, distributed organisational
                        archives,
                        mobile devices, drones, sensors, etc.) with a particular focus on sensing using mobile phones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How to use the captured information (e.g. for knowledge management, business intelligence,
                        customer
                        analysis, management of large scale events via social media, etc.) with a particular focus on
                        data analytics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How to communicate the information (to final users, problem owners, etc.) through visual
                        analytics.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Research areas covered are knowledge and information management, Web technologies, human computer
                    interaction, search technologies and large scale analysis of social media data. <br/></p>


                <p>My research income since 2006 tops £8.5 million, of which around 20% directly from industry (e.g.,
                    Rolls-Royce
                    plc, JustGiving, Football Whispers, etc.). I
                    have co-created two spin-out companies : <a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;"

                    (a company providing car
                    telematics solutions for insurance to hundreds of thousands of users on four continents). <br/></p>


                <p>Application areas and success stories:<br/></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sensing via mobile phones and low cost architectures (Arduino, Raspberry PI). I have developed:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Tracking via Mobile Phones: I have created a human mobility tracking technology in use
                                by over 530,000 users in the UK, used for supporting governmental campaigns for health
                                and wellbeing
                                as well as to understand mobility in large metropolitan areas. For example this is used
                                in <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/active10/home" >Active 10</a> on behalf of Public Health England. This is an app and server infrastructure designed to collect sub-minute tracking data from hundreds of thousands of citizens.
                                We also developed MoveMore <a href="http://www.movemoresheffield.com/">MoveMore initiative</a> a project
                                that aims to make Sheffield the city in the Uk that "moves more" by 2020.
                                It is also used in the <a href="http://setamobility.org">European project Seta </a>I
                                coordinate to track mobility in three European cities
                                (Birmingham, Santander and Turin)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                EyesOnTheGround: a method to turn any citizen camera into a camera for the emergency
                                control room.
                                The citizen will receive a text message with a link. Clicking on the link will share the
                                camera with the control room. The control room will be able to
                                communicate with the citizen via bidirectional audio, control the citizen phone
                                (switching between front and back camera), identifying the exact citizen position via
                                the phone GPS,
                                as well as recording the video interaction and taking screenshots and notes. For
                                situation where installation
                                of an app in advance is feasible, I have developed also the corresponding Android and
                                iOS apps. This technology is now finding
                                application in hospitals to support occupational therapists.
